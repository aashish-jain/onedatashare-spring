Continuation to installation steps mentioned in README file.  

Please ensure that Docker is installed on your host machine.

1. Open Dockerfile file in the root direcotry of the project and configure all the necessary environment variables.  
   Please contact the ODS development team for environment variables setup information using the contact details mentioned in the README file.  

2. Open a terminal window (or command prompt) from the root directory (directory containing the docker-compose.yml file).

3. Execute the following command which creates the containers with all the configurations and starts them :  
   docker-compose up

4. Open your web browser and navigate to http://127.0.0.1:8080

Note -  
The first run of step 3 will require a significant amount of time since it creates the containers from the base Docker images, makes necessary configurations and downloads all the maven dependencies.  
Subsequent runs will be quick since the configured containers are already available and Docker just starts up those containers.
